<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, I'm Ms.Newell. I grew up in Davis, CA but I have lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for most of my adult life. I have two children, and currently I teach computer science at Piedmont High. Read on to learn more.</p>

<p>After graduating from Davis High, I went on to study math at UC San Diego. During that time I decided to take some Chinese classes, which led me to study abroad in Taiwan. The person who later became my husband was also studying abroad there at the same time. So Taiwan is an important place to us, and we both still enjoy visiting the island. Also, I did end up learning quite a bit of Mandarin.</p>

<p>However, most of the time I was more focused on math, and later became interested in computer science, which is how I ended up working in my current position. Before teaching at Piedmont High, I taught math and computer science at other schools in the bay area</p>
